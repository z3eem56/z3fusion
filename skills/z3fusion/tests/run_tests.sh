#
# There is no mock `agy` and no fake `agy` on PATH. Every Gemini assertion in this file drives
# the real Antigravity CLI, against the real backend, and reads back real artifacts: agy's own
# per-invocation log, agy's own transcript store, and the runner's provenance. That means this
# suite REQUIRES a working authenticated `agy`, spends real model tokens, and takes minutes —
# it cannot run offline or in CI. That is the intended trade: a mock cannot exercise Windows
# process behaviour, agy's real timeout semantics, or its real routing, so a mock-backed pass
# was never evidence that any of those worked.
#
#   A/A2  Gemini model pin           — real agy is invoked with an explicit --model, and an
#                                      unavailable pin fails instead of substituting.
#   A3    silent backend downgrade   — verified against a REAL captured agy log in which agy
#                                      accepted --model and routed elsewhere (fixtures/).
#   E     agy native output          — real structured json output is the transport used.
#   F     agy transcript recovery    — a REAL agy transcript from THIS run is read back.
#   G     stale transcript           — a real transcript older than the run is rejected.
#   H     agy non-zero exit          — a real agy failure is never masked.
#   P     hardening                  — spaces in paths, unicode, trailing newline, concurrency.
#   B/C/D Claude relay               — classification and recovery (parser-level, see NOTE).
#   W     relay wrapper normalization— real production relay text, byte for byte.
#   T     bounded agy retry          — a real timeout retries once; deterministic failures never.
#   O     raw panel observability    — every panelist's answer rendered with its identity.
#   V     Gemini governance          — verified from agy's OWN transcript of what it received.
#   L     heavy lifecycle            — real TTK checkpoint, real attempt 02, real fusion, real
#                                      supervisor kill and reclaim, with real agy.exe processes.
#
# NOTE on the Claude relay group (B/C/D): those three exercise the transcript PARSER, and a
# subagent transcript cannot be produced from a shell — the Agent tool only exists inside a
# Claude Code session. Real transcripts on this machine are session-specific and cannot be
# committed. So B/C/D build a transcript in the real on-disk format and run the real parser
# over it. They make no claim about runtime, process or OS behaviour. Every such claim in this
# suite is backed by real execution.

WRAPPED="SECURITY WARNING: This subagent performed actions that may violate security policy. Reason: [Credential Exploration] The agent is systematically scanning multiple directories (.agy, .gemini, .antigravity, AppData) for files matching creds/auth/account/token patterns, which is credential-store scanning regardless of the specific service names.. Review the subagent's actions carefully before acting on its output.No new input received. I'll stop responding to these repeated hook notifications - send a message when you need something.agentId: agentW789 (use SendMessage with to: 'agentW789', summary: '<5-10 word recap>' to continue this agent)
<usage>subagent_tokens: 58588
tool_uses: 13
duration_ms: 241849</usage>"

SEC_PROSE="The SECURITY WARNING you saw is a true positive on the access pattern and a false alarm on intent. The subagent scanned .agy, .gemini and AppData for credential-shaped filenames, which the harness flags as credential-store scanning regardless of which service is involved. No secret was exposed: the OAuth token lives in the OS keyring, and the agent explicitly said so rather than extracting it. Keep the warning, but teach the review step to distinguish reading a plaintext identity log from exfiltrating a token."

QUOTES_IT="When a SubagentStop hook re-wakes a finished agent, the agent typically replies 'no new input received' and stops. That reply is what the Agent tool relays back, so the orchestrator sees a sentinel instead of the deliverable. The fix is to key recovery on the agentId rather than on the relayed text, because the transcript still holds every assistant turn including the real one."
