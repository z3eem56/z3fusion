# gemini_heavy.sh — heavy/long-running Gemini execution lifecycle for z3Fusion.

#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHY THIS EXISTS
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# A heavy Gemini mission — repository-wide analysis, frontend implementation, iterative
# coding/testing/debugging — legitimately runs for hours. Two things break under that load:
#
#   1. A long run is not a failed run. Hitting the time-to-kill boundary must be a CHECKPOINT
#      + HANDOFF, not delete-and-restart. Work already produced has to survive.
#   2. The caller cannot hold the process. Claude's Bash tool caps a foreground call at ~10
#      minutes; agy children outlive it. Previously the caller stopped waiting, the original
#      agy kept running, a second agy was launched, and both eventually wrote the SAME result
#      path. Attempt isolation plus job re-attach removes that failure mode by construction.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# LIFECYCLE
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#   ATTEMPT-01 (up to TTK)
#      |-- completes ................ canonical = attempt-01, DONE. No attempt-02, no fusion.
#      |-- reaches TTK .............. capture checkpoint, seal, continue to ATTEMPT-02
#      `-- deterministic failure .... abort. A pin mismatch / auth rejection / stale transcript
#                                     cannot be fixed by burning another 8 hours.
#   ATTEMPT-02 (up to TTK, FRESH context, same mission)
#   FUSION      compares both attempts + real repository evidence -> canonical result
#
# Attempt-02 is deliberately a fresh Gemini execution rather than `agy --continue`: two
# independent reasoning paths over the same mission are worth more than one path resumed, and
# it matches z3Fusion's own independence-then-synthesis thesis. The attempts DO share whatever
# project state attempt-01 left on disk — that is expected and is evidence, not leakage.
# Attempt-02 never sees attempt-01's TEXT before producing its own; only fusion sees both.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# WHAT THIS SCRIPT DOES NOT REIMPLEMENT
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Every agy invocation — both attempts and the fusion pass — goes through run_gemini.sh. The
# model pin, the post-run routing verification, the karpathy-engineering-v1 governance
# injection, the layered json/text/transcript transport and the per-invocation provenance are
# therefore inherited unchanged, not duplicated. This script owns the LIFECYCLE only.
#
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# REASONING EFFORT (verified against agy 1.1.8 on this machine)
# ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# The highest supported reasoning effort for this model is expressed BY THE MODEL LABEL, not by
# `--effort`. Probed directly:
#   --model "Gemini 3.1 Pro (High)" --effort high
#       -> ERROR: --effort is not supported for model "Gemini 3.1 Pro (High)"
#   --model gemini-3.1-pro --effort high
#       -> exit 0, SUCCESS, and silently routed to "Gemini 3.6 Flash (High)"
# So `--effort` is the mechanism for labels that do NOT encode a tier; adding it here would
# either hard-fail the run or downgrade it to Flash. The existing pin already selects the
# highest tier. Provenance records reasoning_effort=high with that resolution noted.
#
# Config (env):
#   Z3F_GEMINI_TTK          seconds per attempt. DEFAULT 28800 (8 hours).
#   Z3F_GEMINI_TTK_GRACE    external backstop grace over TTK, seconds (default 300).
#   Z3F_GEMINI_MAX_ATTEMPTS default 2. Clamped 1..3.
#   Z3F_GEMINI_FUSION       1 (default) = run the fusion pass when 2 attempts produced output.
#   Z3F_GEMINI_PROJECT_DIR  repo whose git state is captured as fusion evidence (optional).
#   Z3F_JOBS_ROOT           default ~/.claude/z3fusion-runs/jobs
#   Z3F_WAIT_SECONDS        how long `run` waits before returning 75 (default 540).
#   Z3F_JOB_SUFFIX          disambiguates two jobs with an identical mission prompt.
#
# Exit codes for `run`/`collect`:
#   0 canonical result written | 75 still running, re-invoke to re-attach (NOT a failure)
#   1 failed | 124 every attempt hit TTK with nothing usable | 127 agy missing | 2 bad usage

# ATTEMPT OUTPUT FUSION

You previously worked on the mission below TWICE, independently — two separate executions, each
reasoning from scratch. Both transcripts are given to you now. Produce the single strongest
final answer to the mission.

Attempt 01 finished with status: $s1
Attempt 02 finished with status: $s2

Rules for this fusion pass:

- Do NOT prefer attempt 02 merely because it ran later. Do NOT discard attempt 01 merely
  because it reached its time boundary. Judge them on merit.
- A "ttk-checkpoint" attempt is PARTIAL WORK THAT WAS PRESERVED ON PURPOSE. If it contains the
  better architecture, the better implementation or a finding the other attempt missed, use it.
  Partial does not mean worthless.
- Identify explicitly: consensus, disagreements, what each attempt actually completed, the
  stronger implementation choices, missing pieces, complementary discoveries, conflicting edits
  or conclusions, tests performed, tests still missing.
- Where the attempts conflict, prefer the one supported by the repository evidence below over
  the one that merely asserts it. A claim is not a result.
- The expected outcome is usually a COMBINATION: one attempt's implementation plus the other's
  fixes and verification — not a winner-takes-all pick.
- Output the final answer to the mission itself, not a report about the two attempts. Put a
  short "Fusion notes" section at the end recording what you took from each and why.

## YOUR INPUTS ARE FILES, NOT TEXT IN THIS PROMPT

Read them with your own file tools from the working directory before answering:

    fusion-input/manifest.json         index: every artifact, its size and its sha256
    fusion-input/mission.md            the original mission
    fusion-input/attempt-01.md         attempt 01's full output (status above)
    fusion-input/attempt-02.md         attempt 02's full output (status above)
    fusion-input/repo-evidence.md      actual on-disk repository state, authoritative

Read every file listed in the manifest. If a file's byte size does not match the manifest,
say so explicitly in your answer rather than proceeding as if the evidence were complete.
